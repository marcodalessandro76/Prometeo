# Prometeo
Prometeo is a template project. The aim of its development is to built a C++ based program with a native python interface. 
As an example the project implement the coding of a simple MonteCarlo simulation for the computation of pi.
Input, logs and report files are written in Yaml.

## Installation of the ProPy interface 
ProPy is the python interface of the package, which is the main tool to interact with the code
To install the package move inside the PropY folder and install the package using the pip tools,

    pip3 install -e .

Note that the _editable_ -e option creates a link from the location of the package to local python repository folder.
In this way you do not need to recompile the package if you make some modifications, useful for coding.

## Build of the main code

## Documentation

## Tutorial and examples
We provide many jupyter notebooks that explain the usage of the code.
